In this report, we have explain what a flash loan is, and what some use cases
for them are. We will explain the relevant background for the use cases, as well
as discuss the ethics of the different uses cases. We go into depth around the
use case of arbitrage opportunities, and explain how to detect them, as well as
maximize the profits when using them. We will explain our partial implementation
of a system for detecting, and using these opportunities. Finally, we will
discuss how our project went, what we would have done differently, and what we
would do in the future, if we were to continue on the project.
