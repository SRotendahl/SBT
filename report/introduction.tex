During the inital part of the course (Subjects in blockchain techonology), we
were introduced to flash loans, which promise to give the average person the
liquidity of a whale. From an interest in the mechanic, we arrived at the
following:\\\\
\textit{We wish to investigate whether it is possible, without deep financial
knowledge, to utilize flash loans in the DeFi ecosystem, for monetary
gain. Further, we will investigate whether it is possible to accomplish in
an automated fashion, and if it can be formulated as an optimization
problem, that can be solved. We will base this investigation off previous
``exploits'', and try to implement our own as a demonstration.}\\\\
Using the knowledge we have gained from the lectures and researching on our own,
we set out to find an answer to this question.\\\\
The rest of the report is organized as follows; Section \ref{back}
will look into the neccesary financial knowledge to understand utilize
flash loans. With that knowledge section \ref{use} will look into some
use cases for flash loans. Section \ref{ex} will then examine some
"attacks" on DeFi using flash loans. With this survey of flash loans
done we will look closer at arbitrage specifically in section
\ref{arb}, which leads into an implementation of a prototype in
section \ref{imp}. We then reflect on te project in section \ref{eval}
before forming a conclusion in section \ref{con}.
