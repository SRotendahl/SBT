During the inital part of the course (Subjects in blockchain techonology), we
were introduced to flash loans, which promise to give the average person the
liquidity of a whale. From an interest in the mechanic, we arrived at the
following:\\\\
\textit{We wish to investigate whether it is possible, without deep financial
knowledge, to utilize flash loans in the DeFi ecosystem, for monetary
gain. Further, we will investigate whether it is possible to accomplish in
an automated fashion, and if it can be formulated as an optimization
problem, that can be solved. We will base this investigation off previous
``exploits'', and try to implement our own as a demonstration.}\\\\
Using the knowledge we have gained from the lectures and researching on our own,
we set out to find an answer to this question.
