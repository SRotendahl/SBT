The main part of this trade is a margin trade on the DEX bZx to increase the price on the Uniswap DEX. The trader uses this manipulated price on Uniswap for arbitrage. Let look at exactly what the trader does, by looking at figure \ref{fig:pumpAndArb}; 1) A flash loan is taken with the trader borrowing 10,000 ETH 2) he then lends 5,500 ETH to mint 274,843.68 cETH 3) which he uses as collateral to borrow 112.00 WBTC. 4) He then performs a margin trade, with 5x leverage, for ETH against WBTC on bZx. When bZx receives the request they convert 5,637.62 ETH to 51.35 WBTC, that is 109.79 ETH/WBTC on average with a high of 124.41 ETH/WBTC, for context, at the start of the block this transaction happened in Uniswap was at 36.55 ETH/WBTC, this means that the price slipped from 36.55 to 124.41 that is a slippage of $\frac{124.41-36.55}{36.55}\approx 240\%$ which both Uniswap\footnote{This is with Uniswap v1} and bZx allows. 5) The trader then converts the 112.00 WBTC he borrowed earlier, to 6,871.41 ETH (at 61.35 ETH/WBTC). 6) The trader then pays back the loan with the remaining 3200 ETH from the flash loan and the 6,871.41 ETH he just got, netting a profit off 71.41 ETH.

However this is not the real price, the real price is the over-collateralized loan of 5,500 ETH for 112 WBTC at 49.10 ETH/WBTC because this is fairly high so over a period of two days (steps a-c in figure \ref{pumpAndArb}) the trader exchanges 4,377.72 ETH for 112 WBTC, at 39.08 ETH/WBTC, to redeem the 5,500 ETH thereby making 10.02 ETH per WBTC and adding in the 71.41 he made earlier the total profit is 1,193.65 ETH. The loser here is bZx since when converting 5,637.62 ETH to 51.35 WBTC they have an average conversion rate of 109.78 ETH/WBTC, but at the time the market exchange rate was about 39.08 ETH/WBTC so they lend the trader $5,637.62-1,300=4,337.62$ ETH, but for that they end up with 51.35 WBTC which is worth about $51.35*39.08=2,330.86$ ETH thereby losing $4,337.62-2,330.86=2,006.76$ ETH.

\paragraph{Oracle manipulation} A visualization of this example can be see in figure \ref{fig:oracle}, figure \ref{fig:oracle} is from \cite{attack} where they describe the procedure, which we will explain here.

The main part of this trade is converting ETH to sUSD in order to lower the price of sUSD/ETH, and then lend from a platform which uses the conversion rate to borrow ETH at a low cost. In more detail the trader; 1) borrows 7,500 ETH using a flash loan 2) convert 540 ETH to 92,419.7 sUDS at 171.15 sUSD/ETH (on the Kyber-Uniswap reserve), 3) he then converts 360 ETH to 63,584.09 sUSD at 111.23 sUSD/ETH (on Kyber) over are series of conversions. These two steps are done in order to lower the sUSD/ETH price on Kyber, and 4) he converts 3,517.86 ETH to 943,837.59 sUSD and he now has a total of $92,419.7+63,584.09+943,837.59=1,099.841.38$ sUSD 5) which he uses as collateral to borrow 6,799.27 ETH at 162.66 sUSD/ETH on bZx, and 6) pays back the (flash) loan to bZx.

The key point is that bZx uses Kyber as a price oracle so with the lowered price he can now borrow a lot more ETH using the sUSD than the normal market rates would indicate, this can be see by the simple calculation that he spends $540+360+3,517.86=4,417.86$ ETH to borrow 6,799.27 ETH, that is a profit of $6,799.27-4,417.86=2,381.41$ ETH. He ends up manipulating the prices on Kyber from 268.30 sUDS/ETH to 107.83 sUSD/ETH (remember the conversion rates mentioned in the steps are averages, while these two numbers are the highs and lows). The loser here is bZx, they lend 6,799.27 ETH to the trader for 1,099,841 sUSD which is worth approximately 4,099.29 ETH (give an estimated rate of 268.30 sUSD/ETH at the time), so they lose $6,799.27-4,099.29=2,699.97$ ETH.
