All in all the project went well and we managed to get the financial knowledge
on how to detect/utilize arbitrage opportunities. Currently it is mostly the
implementation that is holding us back, from deploying the contract and earning
money. We have surveyed some use cases of flash loans, and how they can give
blockchain users the liquitity of a whale. We have discussed the ethics of
different uses cases, and finally partially implemented a system, for using
arbitrage opportunities.
