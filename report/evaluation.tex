% What we accomplished
\subsection{Reflection on research question}
In our research question we set out to investigate whether it was possible,
without deep financial knowledge, to utilize flash loans for monetary gain. We
have during the moth of August tried to find an answer to this. While we have
not shown, that it indeed is possible, we have come up with the theory for doing
so. So in essence the answer probably lies inbetween yes and no. You will need
to spend some time doing research, but it is not out of reach for the average
student at the science faculty to figure out arbitrage opportunities on the DeFi
market.

\subsection{Minimum required future work}
\noindent We also wanted to find out if it was possible to automate acting on
arbitrage opportunities. While we firmly believe this is possible, it does take
a great deal of effort to be able to do without some risk. Some of the things
we would need to continue working on is:

\paragraph{How important is it to utilize an arbitrage opportunity in the next
block?} When is the opportunity gone, and how many times will someone use it
before you.
\paragraph{Gas prices} How much does it cost to run the code for an arbitrage
opportunity. When is the cutoff, where it is no longer profitable due to the
cost of gas?
\paragraph{Risk analysis} We would need to asses how much we can lose before it
becomes unprofitable, and what the actual profit is. If we e.g. will earn little
money, but risk to lose a lot, it would not be worth it in the end.\\\\
% We would rather have focued
% How it went
All in all the project went well and we managed to get the financial knowledge
on how to utilize arbitrage opportunities. Currently it is mostly the
implementation that is holding us back, from deploying the contract and earning
money. We spent more time on getting a broad knowledge. We could in hindsight
have limited our scope without losing the ability to find arbitrage
opportunities.
