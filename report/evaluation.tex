% What we accomplished
\subsection{Reflection on the research question}
In our research question, we set out to investigate whether it was possible,
without deep financial knowledge, to utilize flash loans for monetary gain. We
have during the month of August tried to find an answer to this. While we have
not shown that it is possible, we have come up with the theory for doing so. So
in essence the answer probably lies in between yes and no. We would need to
spend some time doing more research, but it is not out of reach for the average
student at the science faculty to find arbitrage opportunities on the DeFi
market.

\subsection{Minimum required future work}
\noindent We also wanted to find out if it was possible to automate acting on
arbitrage opportunities. While we firmly believe this is possible, we not, so
far, been able to create the system to do so. The following are some of the
things we would need to continue working on: 

\paragraph{How important is it to utilize an arbitrage opportunity in the next
block?} When is the opportunity gone, and how many times will someone use it
before you? If the opportunity changes so much between detecting it, and
executing on it, that it is no longer profitable, we would still need to pay for
the gas used. If this happens a lot, we might end up with an overall
unprofitable system, even if some transactions make money.
\paragraph{Gas prices} How much does it cost to run the code for an arbitrage
opportunity? Where is the cutoff, when it is no longer profitable due to the
cost of gas?
\paragraph{Fees incurred} Our theory assumes that there are no fees on the
exchanges, which there are. We would therefore need to adjust our calculations,
to take this into account. We do however believe, that this would be a
relatively minor adjustment to make.
\paragraph{Risk analysis} We would need to try to estimate the risk of a
transaction not going through, and thereby losing money in the form of gas.\\\\
% We would rather have focused
% How it went
During this project, we probably spent too much time getting broad knowledge. We
could in hindsight have limited our scope without losing the ability to find
arbitrage opportunities. The limited scope would be focused on understanding
AMMs, and arbitrage, and not have included the rest of the attacks that we have
discussed in this report.
