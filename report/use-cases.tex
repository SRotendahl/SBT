Flash loans does not enable anything new it simply allows everyone to be able to trade with large amounts of capital (in one transaction), if you did indeed posses a vast amount of wealth (if you are a whale) then flash loans are not really of interest to you, you can already do the things it allows. With that in mind however, lets look at use cases for flash loans where most of them are interesting because everyone can now do them, not just a select few with a lot of capital.

\paragraph{Arbitrage} An asset' value is determined through supply and demand, so if there is a larger supply of the asset than there is demand the price will go down and if the supply goes down (while the demand stays the same) the price goes up. This is reflected in the different DEX's, however they do not instantly synchronize, so if one DEX trades an asset for a lower price than another, then there is an \textit{arbitrage} opportunity. Arbitrage is the process of making profit off of these prices difference. The prices differences will usually be small so in order to make a significant amount of money you will need a great deal of capital and this is where flash loans comes in.
